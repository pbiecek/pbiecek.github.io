## Mission

My personal mission is to enhance human capabilities by supporting them through access to data-driven and knowledge-based predictions. I execute it by developing methods and tools for responsible machine learning, trustworthy artificial intelligence and reliable software engineering.


## MI^2 research group

I lead [MI2.AI](https://MI2.AI) group of model science enthusiasts, mostly from Math and Computer Science departments from University of Warsaw or Warsaw University of Technology. Together we create tools, try new methods and look for interesting opportunities to squeeze useful information from vast amount of data.

Current and former senior members (see the team's website for a complete current list):

## Short Bio

Przemysław Biecek, PhD, is a Full Professor at both the Warsaw University of Technology and the University of Warsaw, specializing in mathematical statistics, machine learning, and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). He leads the [MI2.AI](https://MI2.AI) group (read "M-I-square"), which focuses on developing tools and methods for responsible machine learning, with applications spanning biomedicine, computational oncology, space technologies, and other frontier domains.

Among his most notable contributions are the [DrWhy.AI](https://drwhy.ai) framework and the DALEX package, widely used for model interpretability, validation and control. His research bridges statistical rigor with real-world impact, aiming to improve human decision-making through transparent, trustworthy AI systems.

Prof. Biecek has collaborated with global organizations such as Samsung, IBM, Disney, and Netezza, and is the founder of Solutions42.ai — a company committed to deploying responsible AI solutions. A strong advocate for data literacy and open science, he actively contributes to the open-source community and promotes evidence-based approaches in artificial intelligence. His work has been recognized at leading conferences, including ICML, CVPR, ECCV, AAAI, ECML, and ECAI.

## Solutions42.ai

Over the last 15 years I have carried out research and development for a number of public (University of Warsaw, Warsaw University of Technology) and private organisations (Samsung, Netezza, IBM, PositiveSolutions, Disney, iQor, LekSeek). In 2021 I founded Solutions42 to share this experience with other companies.

[Solutions42.ai](https://www.solutions42.ai/) is an agile company helping large and small partners to design, implement and deploy Responsible Artificial Intelligence solutions.

We take an individual approach to each customer. We provide trainings, develop software, validate existing models or create new ones.

If you would like to discuss a possible collaboration, feel free to contact me.


## Attitude

I am a data-driven person got it from my mentors. My PhD advisor in math was [Witold Klonecki](http://www.ibspan.waw.pl/komisja.statystyki/wspomnienia/Klonecki.pdf). His PhD advisor was [Julian Perkal](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Perkal). And his PhD advisor was [Hugo Steinhaus](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Steinhaus). And his advisor was [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert). My PhD advisor in biology was [Stanislaw Cebrat](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Cebrat).
