excerpt: 'The KRAB ZNF Explorer is a web-based tool designed to analyze mRNA expression patterns of KRAB-ZNF transcription factors using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. It enables comparative analyses between normal and cancer tissues, explores associations with pathological features and DNA methylation, and includes survival analysis and isoform-level expression profiling.'

Krüppel-associated box domain zinc finger protein (KRAB ZNF) explorer is a web-based tool for comprehensive characterization of the mRNA expression status of KRAB-ZNF transcription factors in the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas study. Key functionalities cover a comparative analysis of KRAB-ZNF expression between normal and cancer tissues, an association of KRAB-ZNF expression with various pathological features, including survival analysis, association with global DNA methylation status, analyses of KRAB-ZNF isoform expressions and analysis of KRAB-ZNF levels in normal tissues.
