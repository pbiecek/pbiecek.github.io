excerpt: 'This paper investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to manipulate human decisions by analyzing both user susceptibility and LLM persuasion strategies through controlled experiments. It proposes two mitigation strategies: promoting AI literacy to reduce long-term risks and introducing a "Manipulation Fuse" classifier to detect manipulative content in real-time.'

If AI is the new electricity, what should we do to keep ourselves from getting electrocuted? In this work, we explore factors related to the potential of large language models (LLMs) to manipulate human decisions. We describe the results of two experiments designed to determine what characteristics of humans are associated with their susceptibility to LLM manipulation, and what characteristics of LLMs are associated with their manipulativeness potential. We explore human factors by conducting user studies in which participants answer general knowledge questions using LLM-generated hints, whereas LLM factors by provoking language models to create manipulative statements. Then, we analyze their obedience, the persuasion strategies used, and the choice of vocabulary. Based on these experiments, we discuss two actions that can protect us from LLM manipulation. In the long term, we put AI literacy at the forefront, arguing that educating society would minimize the risk of manipulation and its consequences. We also propose an ad hoc solution, a classifier that detects LLM manipulation – a Manipulation Fuse.
