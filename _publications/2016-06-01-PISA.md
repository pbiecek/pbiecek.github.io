excerpt: 'This paper investigates academic endurance—students’ ability to sustain performance throughout low-stakes cognitive tests—using PISA data from over 450,000 students across 60+ countries. The study finds significant endurance disparities across countries and subgroups, with sharper declines in performance among boys, socio-economically disadvantaged students, and during reading assessments, particularly influenced by question format.'

The paper examines academic endurance, defined as students' ability to maintain their baseline rates of successful test completion for the duration of a low-stakes cognitive test. The random allocation of test booklets to students in the Programme for International Student Assessment (15-year-olds, 60 + countries, N > 450,000) offers a natural experiment to examine whether the decline in students' correct responses to test items placed at the beginning vs. at the end of the booklet varies across countries, population subgroups, and assessment domains. Results reveal differences in academic endurance both between countries and within countries across different population subgroups. The decline in students' correct responses tends to be more pronounced among boys, among socio-economically disadvantaged students and when students solve the reading part of the PISA test. In some countries students' endurance in reading, mathematics and science depends on the response format of the assessment questions.
