excerpt: 'This paper presents survex, an R package offering a unified framework for explaining survival models using explainable AI techniques, addressing the interpretability gap in machine learning-based survival analysis. By revealing variable effects, importances, and model decision rationale, survex enhances model transparency, reliability, and trust—especially crucial in sensitive domains like healthcare and biomedical research.'

Due to their flexibility and superior performance, machine learning models frequently complement and outperform traditional
statistical survival models. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by a lack of user-friendly tools to explain their internal operations and
prediction rationales. To tackle this issue, we introduce the survex R package, which provides a cohesive framework for explaining any survival
model by applying explainable artificial intelligence techniques. The capabilities of the proposed software encompass understanding and diagnosing survival models, which can lead to their improvement. By revealing insights into the decision-making process, such as variable effects and
importances, survex enables the assessment of model reliability and the detection of biases. Thus, transparency and responsibility may be
promoted in sensitive areas, such as biomedical research and healthcare applications.
